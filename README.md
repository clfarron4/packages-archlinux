==================

ArchLinux packages in AUR.
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=ido&SeB=m

AUR Packages
------------

All packages that I maintain that are available on AUR are located in the
[`aur`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/aur) directory.

Unmaintained, old packages (e.g. that were disowned) are contained in the
[`old`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/old) directory.

Contributing
------------

Please submit a pull request with any changes to any packages you would like.
While I do check and respond to AUR comments, I strongly prefer that you
contribute changes (i.e. solved problems, upgrades, etc.) to this repository.

If you believe an issue requires discussion to resolve, then an AUR comment or
GitHub issue is appropriate.  (Use AUR comments when you want feedback from
AUR user community as well as me, or GitHub issues when you mainly care about
my feedback only.)

AUR Packages
------------

All packages that I maintain that are available on AUR are located in the
[`aur`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/aur) directory.  Unmaintained, old packages (e.g. that were disowned) are
contained in the [`old`](https://github.com/ido/packages-archlinux/tree/master/old) directory.
